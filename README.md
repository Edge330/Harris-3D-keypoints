# Harris-3D-keypoints
Example of Harris 3D keypoints algorithm using Point Cloud Library (PCL).

HarrisKeypoint3D uses the idea of 2D Harris keypoints, but instead of using image gradients, it uses surface normals.

Source file also include viewer settings to show the keypoints on orginal cloud.

If you are not happy with result try adjust some parameters.
